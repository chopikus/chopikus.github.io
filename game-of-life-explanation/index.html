      <h3>Game description</h3>
      <p>Conway's Game of Life is one of the most well-known cellular automata.
      <p>It was developed by the British mathematician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway">John Conway</a> in 1970.
      </p>
      <p>The game rules are simple:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>There is an infinite grid of cells, each cell is either ON or OFF.</li>
          <li>Every cell interacts with it's 8 direct neighbours.
              <br>The next generation is computed the following way:
              <ol>
                  <li>Any ON cell with 2 or 3 ON neighbours stays ON.</li>
                  <li>Any OFF cell with 3 ON neighbours turns ON.</li>
                  <li>In other cases cell turns OFF.</li>
              </ol>
          </li>
          <li>The next state is computed for all cells at the same time.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As you can see, the state at each generation is only determined by the original configuration of the grid, not requiring user input.</p>

      <h3>Computing next generation</h3>
        <h4>First approach: Direct implementation</h4>
        <p>The simplest algorithm to compute next generation is a direct one, storing all the cells of a finite grid.</p>
        <p> Note that we need to store current and next generation separately on computation: otherwise cells won't be computed all at once.</p>
        <p> Overall it requries O(n*m) time and space to compute one generation forward.</p>
        <p> The disadvantages of this approach are clear, it doesn't work fast enough for big patterns, and requires too much memory. </p>
        <h4>Second approach: assuming there are far less ON cells than OFF cells</h4>
        <p>Instead of storing all cells of the grid it is sufficient to store the positions of ON cells.</p>
        <p>We could compute the result for less cells as well: if all of our neighbours have OFF state, the cell will be OFF for the next generation. </p>
        <p>If all active cells at current generation are inside of rectangle ((min_x, min_y), (max_x, max_y)), it is sufficient to compute next cells in rectangle ((min_x-1, min_y-1), (max_x+1, max_y+1)).</p>
        <figure style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="c.png" style="height:150px;">
        <figcaption style="text-align: center;">Notice that we don't need to compute the result for red cells.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h5> Advantages: </h5>
        <p>Compared to the first approach, this one works much better for infinite small patterns, such as glider.</p>
        <figure style="text-align: center;">
          <img style="height:250px;" src="glider.gif">
          <figcaption style="text-align: center;">Glider (<a href="https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/ITKE/uploads/blogs.dir/209/files/2017/07/glider-1.gif">source</a>)</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>We store only 5 cells at a time, and compute the result for 25 cells at a time.</p>
        <h5> Disadvantages: </h5>
        <ul>
        <li>This approach is still too slow to compute millions of generations per second. </li>
        <li>Since we store the active cells consecutively, we draw all the active cells no matter the scale. 
            <br> When the scale gets so small that we have more than one cell per pixel, drawing becomes hugely inefficient. </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Third approach: Hashlife (used in implementation)</h4>
        <p><a href="https://johnhw.github.io/hashlife/index.md.html">This</a> explanation of the algorithm by John H Williamson is much better than any I could write. </p> 
        <p>To summarize shortly, we store the grid as a block of 2^n by 2^n cells, take 2^(n-1) by 2^(n-1) nodes in the middle, and for those nodes compute 2^(n-2) generations forward.       </p> 
        <p>As name suggests, hashing is very actively used, for repetitive patterns this algorithm gets faster and faster with time. </p>
      <h3>Implementation</h3>
        <p><b>The project's repository is here:</b> <a href="https://github.com/chopikus/game-of-life">https://github.com/chopikus/game-of-life</a>.</p>
        <p>The compute next states of the grid, I implemented Hashlife in Rust using <a href="https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen">wasm-bindgen</a>.
        <p>Previously I used C++ and Emscripten to do this project, however I stumbled upon weird memory issues that are hard to reproduce and depend on specific Emscripten versions. Besides, all of computation was done on a single thread, so UI became unresponsive if pattern was too heavy. </p>

        <p>I moved the grid computation code to Rust to ensure memory safety.
        <br>Cells are visualized with <code>OffscreenCanvas</code>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/OffscreenCanvas">which is now supported in all major browsers.</a> </p>

        <p>Overall, 3 different threads are used: one for cell computation, one for canvas drawing, and another for UI.</p>

        <h4>File format</h4>
        The description of .rle file format is here: <a href="https://conwaylife.com/wiki/Run_Length_Encoded">https://conwaylife.com/wiki/Run_Length_Encoded</a> 
        <h4>Downsampling</h4>
        <p>What happens if we scale the grid out so much that one pixel corresponds to more than one cell?</p>
        <p>To make sure drawing cells stays performant, we use the following algorithm.
        <br>if a whole square of 2^k by 2^k pixels corresponds to one pixel, we draw that pixel white if that square has at least one ON cell.</p>  
        <p>This algorithm can be best described with code:</p>
<pre><code>/*Following function pushes coordinates of ON cells in node up with (2^level):1 precision.*/
fn append_alive_cells(&self, node: Rc<Node>, output: &mut Vec<Cell>, level: u8, x: i64, y: i64, bounds: [i64; 4]) {
    /* ignore the node completely if all cells inside are OFF. */
    <b>if !node.n() {
        return;
    } </b>

    let size: i64 = 1 << node.k();
    let [min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y] = bounds;

    if x + size <= min_x || x > max_x {
        return;
    }
    
    if y + size <= min_y || y > max_y {
        return;
    }
    
    /* Following if statement allows to compute with 'level' precision. */
    <b>if node.k() == level {
        output.push(Cell{x: x - self.shift_x, y: y - self.shift_y});
        return;
    }</b>

    let offset: i64 = size >> 1;
    let [a, b, c, d] = node.unwrap_children_cloned();

    self.append_alive_cells(a, output, level, x, y, bounds);
    self.append_alive_cells(b, output, level, x + offset, y, bounds);
    self.append_alive_cells(c, output, level, x, y + offset, bounds);
    self.append_alive_cells(d, output, level, x + offset, y + offset, bounds);
}
</code></pre>
      <h4>Optimizing passing data between Rust and JS</h4>
        <p>The fastest solution seems to be to pass the list of <code>i64</code> numbers, where each pair corresponds to a cell coordinate. 
        <br>Rust backend returns a pointer to a vector and it's size, which is then converted to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/BigInt64Array">BigInt64Array</a> in JS.
        <br><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Transferable_objects">Also the buffer of BigInt64Array is transferrable.</a></p>
