      <h3>Game description</h3>
      <p>Conway's Game of Life is one of the most well-known cellular automata.
         <br>It was developed by the British mathematician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway">John Conway</a> in 1970.
      </p>
      <p>The game rules are simple:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>There is an infinite grid of cells, each cell is either ON or OFF.</li>
          <li>Every cell interacts with it's 8 direct neighbours.
              <br>The next generation is computed the following way:
              <ol>
                  <li>Any ON cell with 2 or 3 ON neighbours stays ON.</li>
                  <li>Any OFF cell with 3 ON neighbours turns ON.</li>
                  <li>In other cases cell turns OFF.</li>
              </ol>
          </li>
          <li>The next state is computed for all cells at the same time.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As you can see, the state at each generation is only determined by the original configuration of the grid, not requiring user input.</p>

      </figure>

      <h3>Computing next generation</h3>
        <h4>First approach: Direct implementation</h4>
        <p>The simplest algorithm to compute next generation is a direct one, storing all the cells of a finite grid.
        <br> Note that we need to store current and next generation separately on computation: otherwise cells won't be computed all at once.
        <br> Overall it requries O(n*m) time and space to compute one generation forward.</p>
        <p> The disadvantages of this approach are clear, it doesn't work fast enough for big patterns, and requires too much memory. </p>
        <h4>Second approach: assuming there are far less ON cells than OFF cells</h4>
        <p>Instead of storing all cells of the grid it is sufficient to store the positions of ON cells.
        <br>We could compute the result for less cells as well: if all of our neighbours have OFF state, the cell will be OFF for the next generation. </p>
        <p>If all active cells at current generation are inside of rectangle ((min_x, min_y), (max_x, max_y)), it is sufficient to compute next cells in rectangle ((min_x-1, min_y-1), (max_x+1, max_y+1)).
        </p>
        <figure style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="c.png" style="height:150px;">
        <figcaption style="text-align: center;">Notice that we don't need to compute the result for red cells.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h5> Advantages: </h5>
        <p>Compared to the first approach, this one works much better for infinite small patterns, such as glider.</p>
        <figure style="text-align: center;">
          <img style="height:250px;" src="glider.gif">
          <figcaption style="text-align: center;">Glider (<a href="https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/ITKE/uploads/blogs.dir/209/files/2017/07/glider-1.gif">source</a>)</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>We store only 5 cells at a time, and compute the result for 25 cells at a time.</p>
        <h5> Disadvantages: </h5>
        <ul>
        <li>This approach is still too slow to compute millions of generations per second. </li>
        <li>Since we store the active cells consecutively, we draw all the active cells no matter the scale. 
            <br> When the scale gets so small that we have more than one cell per pixel, drawing becomes hugely inefficient. </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Third approach: Hashlife (used in implementation)</h4>
        <p><a href="https://johnhw.github.io/hashlife/index.md.html">This</a> explanation of the algorithm by John H Williamson is much better than any I could write. </p> 
        <p>To summarize shortly, we store the grid as a block of 2^n by 2^n cells, take 2^(n-1) by 2^(n-1) nodes in the middle, and for those nodes compute 2^(n-2) generations forward.       </p> 
        <p>As name suggests, hashing is very actively used, for repetitive patterns this algorithm gets faster and faster with time. </p>
      <h3>Implementation</h3>
        <p><b>The project's repository is here:</b> <a href="https://chopikus.github.io/game-of-life">https://chopikus.github.io/game-of-liife</a>.</p>
        <p>The compute next states of the grid, I implemented Hashlife in C++ using <a href="https://webassembly.org/">Webassembly</a>.
        <br> To visualize grid and cells I simply used Javascript Canvas API, it works fast enough. </p>
        <p>When it comes to providing an interface between JS and C++, <a href="https://emscripten.org/">Emscripten</a> is the best choice; as it provides support for multithreading, supports allocating lots of RAM in the browser, Google Test also works just fine. </p>
      <h4> Memory usage </h4>
        <p>Since Hashlife algorithm heavily relies on caching results, it requires a lot of RAM.</p>
        <p>Therefore, saving some memory on nodes is preferred.</p>
        <p>This Node class structure works well enough:</p>
        <pre>
          <code>
          struct Node {
            /* ____
              /    \
              |A  B|
              |C  D|
              \___/
            */
            uint8_t kn; // first bit n, rest bits -- k
            std::shared_ptr&ltNode&gt a,b,c,d;
            uint64_t hash; // precomputed
    
            auto operator<=>(const Node&) const = default;
            
            uint8_t k() const;
            bool n() const;
          };
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>To prevent memory leaks and easily track Node's reference count, <code>std::shared_ptr</code> is used.
        <br>Although some might say <code>std::shared_ptr</code> uses too much memory, it helps remove quite a lot of unused nodes when running, saving quite a lot of RAM.</p>
        <h4>Downsampling</h4>
        <p>What happens if we scale out so much that one pixel corresponds to more than one cell?
        <br>Drawing the same pixel multiple times doesn't seem as a great idea.
        <br>To fix that, the following is usually done: if a whole square of 2^k by 2^k pixels corresponds to one pixel, we draw that pixel white if that square has at least one ON cell.</p>  
        <p>In code it looks roughly like this:</p>
        <pre>
          <code>
          /*Following function pushes coordinates of ON cells in node up with (2^level):1 precision.*/
          void Hashlife::_append_alive_cells(const NodePtr& node, std::vector&ltCell&gt& output,
                                            uint8_t level, 
                                            int64_t x, int64_t y,
                                            int64_t min_x, int64_t min_y,
                                            int64_t max_x, int64_t max_y) {
              /* if current node doesn't have any ON cells, pass*/
              if (!node->n()) {
                  return;
              }
          
              if (node->k() == level) {
                  output.push_back({x, y});
                  return;
              }
          
              int64_t offset = size >> 1;
              _append_alive_cells(node->a, output, level, x, y, min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y);
              _append_alive_cells(node->b, output, level, x + offset, y, min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y);
              _append_alive_cells(node->c, output, level, x, y + offset, min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y);
              _append_alive_cells(node->d, output, level, x + offset, y + offset, min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y);
          }
          </code>

      <h4>File format</h4>
        The description of .rle file format is here: <a href="https://conwaylife.com/wiki/Run_Length_Encoded">https://conwaylife.com/wiki/Run_Length_Encoded</a> 
      <h4>Emscripten-level optimizations</h4>
        <p>To draw the cells, the C++ backend passes the list of ON cells.
           Since each cell is simply a pair of numbers, the faster option is to create array on heap in C++ and pass the memory view to JS. </p>
        <a href="https://emscripten.org/docs/porting/connecting_cpp_and_javascript/embind.html#memory-views">See this Emscripten doc for more info. </a>
      <h3>Limitations</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The computation and the drawing is done on a single core; this results in a slower performance than compared to the <a href="https://golly.sourceforge.io/">Golly</a> client for example.</li>
          <li>Parsing large files (16MB) takes a lot of time (10s+).</li>
          <li>Generation speed seems to be off, at least on small values (1, 2 gen/s) </li>
          <li>Computation is done on the main thread, leading to slow reaction on user input on large patterns (button clicks, panning, zoom, etc.) </li>
        </ul>
      <h4>Memory issues</h4>
      <p>For some reason, compiling a Game of Life client with Emscripten version 3.1.59+ results in `memory access out of bounds` error. See <a href="https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/issues/22041">this Github issue</a> for more details. For now, the client is compiled against an older Emscripten version.</p>
